# FCC: Caesars-Cipher

A Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher, is a type of substitution cipher where each letter is replaced by a letter some fixed # of positions down the alphabet.

This project was created as part of the freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification curriculum. I used ReactJS, and Bootstrap styling to build this project.
